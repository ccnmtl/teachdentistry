Teach Dentistry
==========

Teach Dentistry aims to inform and provide confidence to dental practitioners interested in entering dental academics by:

* Having participants choose their interests while learning about the different aspects of dental education.
* Viewing diverse exemplars at different stages of their careers, working in various areas within dental academics.
* Seeking a mentor from a map of dental academicians throughout the country

Developed with support from the Health Resources and Services Administration Title VII Training Grant D86HP24475 on Teaching Tomorrow's Faculty Today.

This Django project was deprecated July 2017, and is not actively maintained.
